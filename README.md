# Fallout 76 CENTRAL MARKET

## Your Task

The player vending machines don't currently have any way of tracking what havebeen sold to other players,so if you don't see the 2-second notification that you sold a weapon or armour you'll have no idea what has been sold.
Players on the Reddit have been asking for something in-game to track it,

Our task  is to build a webapp , where  that allowed you to enter everything in your vending machine and store it in a live database. Youâ€™ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Your app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM,nodemailer and the express-session npm package for authentication.
