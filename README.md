# Fallout 76 CENTRAL MARKET

## Our Task

The player vending machines don't currently have any way of tracking what havebeen sold to other players,so if you don't see the 2-second notification that you sold a weapon or armour you'll have no idea what has been sold.
Players on the Reddit have been asking for something in-game to track it.



## User Story
